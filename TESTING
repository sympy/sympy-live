We currently don't have any automated testing (see
https://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=3578).  So everything has to
be tested by hand.  Make sure to test the following:

- All major web browsers.  Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox, and Internet
  Explorer.  We only need to support the most recent version of each.  If you
  can't test some (because you aren't on a platform that it supports), try to
  get someone else to test if you can.

- The mobile version.  This should be tested on the default browsers for the
  most recent version of each of the major mobile operating systems (again,
  test what you have, and try to get someone else to test the others if you
  can).

- The SymPy Live shell in the docs.  This is the shell at docs.sympy.org.  To
  test this, in the sympy git repo, edit doc/ext/sympylive.py and change the
  url at the bottom from 'http://live.sympy.org' to what you are testing with
  ('http://localhost:8080/' if you are testing locally, the testing
  application if you are deploying).  Then, do `cd doc; make html` in the
  sympy git repo, and them open the docs in `_build`, and make sure that the
  live shell works.  This again should work in the latest version of all major
  web browsers.

See the README for information on how to test locally.
